The Community Diagnostics Package (CDP) is a framework for creating
new climate diagnostic packages in a generalized manner. CDP allows
for a modular implementation of the components required for running
diagnostics. The design of CDP consists of modules to handle the
user-defined parameters, provenance, and viewing results.
