| :warning: WARNING: Maintenance-only mode until around the end of 2023.          |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
The CDAT library is now in maintenance-only mode, with plans for deprecation and cease of support around the end of calendar year 2023. Until this time, the dependencies for specific CDAT packages (`cdms2`, `cdat_info`, `cdutil`, `cdtime`, `genutil`, `libcdms`) will be monitored to ensure they build and install in Conda environments. We currently support Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Unfortunately, feature requests and bug fixes will no longer be addressed.|
If you are interested in an alternative solution, please check out the [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html) and [xCDAT - Xarray Extended With Climate Data Analysis Tools](https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat) projects.|

The Community Diagnostics Package (CDP) is a framework for creating
new climate diagnostic packages in a generalized manner. CDP allows
for a modular implementation of the components required for running
diagnostics. The design of CDP consists of modules to handle the
user-defined parameters, provenance, and viewing results.
