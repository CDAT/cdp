Welcome to the Community Diagnostics Package (CDP) documentation!
===============================

The Analytics and Informatics Managements Systems (AIMS) team and the Lawerence
Livermore National Laboratory is developing the Community Diagnostics Package
(CDP), a framework for creating new climate diagnostic packages in a generalized
manner. Designed in an object-oriented method, CDP allows for a modular
implementation of the components required for running diagnostics. The design of
CDP consists of modules to handle the user-defined parameters, metrics,
provenance, file I/O, output of results and algorithms for calculating the
diagnostics.
