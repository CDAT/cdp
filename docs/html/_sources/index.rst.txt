Overview
--------

The Community Diagnostics Package (CDP) is a framework for creating new climate diagnostic
packages in a generalized manner. CDP allows for a modular implementation of the components
required for running diagnostics. The design of CDP consists of modules to handle the
user-defined parameters, provenance, and viewing results.
